Key Features: Zero-Config : No configuration is necessary to use portray . Just run portray in the root of your Python project and it will find your documentation. Statically Generated : portray websites are easy to host on GitHub pages and other similar services as they are outputted as standard static HTML websites. Markdown Aware : portray will automatically include your projects .md files and render them into HTML. It will also find and render Markdown within __doc__ strings. Fully Configurable : While portray doesn't have to be configured, you still can fully configure it within the standard pyproject.toml file. Easily Programmable : portray exposes a clean and simple Python API . Searchable : Out of the box portray makes all of your documentation, even autogenerated code references, free-text searchable. Themeable : portray is compatible with all existing MkDocs Themes . Under the hood, portray combines the Markdown documentation rendering capabilities provided by MkDocs with the automatic reference documentation generated by pdocs . Quick Start The following guides should get you up and running with a documentation website in no time. Installation - TL;DR: Run pip3 install portray within your projects virtual environment. Command Line Usage - TL;DR: Run portray in_browser to test and portray on_github_pages to deploy. API Usage - TL;DR: Everything available via the CLI is also easily available programmatically from within Python. Configuration - TL;DR: Put all configuration within a [tool.portray] section of your pyproject.toml file. Why Create Portray? I create a lot of Python projects and I've always wanted a quick way to build documentation sites for them that included both manually written guides and autogenerated reference documentation. Tools have improved over the years, but still nothing has given me this experience out of the box. Portray isn't a competitor for the 2 newer Python documentation projects (pdocs and MkDocs), rather it is melding of them together to give me the quick to create and comprehensive documentation website generation I've always wanted. Thanks and I hope you too find portray useful! ~Timothy Crosley","title":"Home"},{"location":"#quick-start","text":"The following guides should get you up and running with a documentation website in no time.

Changelog 1.4.0 - June 12 2020 Upgraded mkdocs-material & pymdown-extensions 1.3.2 - June 07 2020 Bump pdocs dependency to include some package inclusion improvements. Speed up doc copying by only copying markdown files. 1.3.1 - September 22 2019 Fixed Issue 43 - Automatically remap - to _ when attempting to auto-determine module name. Added extra_markdown_extensions config option, to enable adding markdown extensions without having to redefine default set included by portray. 1.3.0 - September 15 2019 Potentially backward compatibility breaking performance optimization: portray now only renders root project files + the specified documentation directory + any specified extra_dirs. If a previously utilized file used to be auto included, but is no longer, you can force its inclusion by adding its directory to extra_dirs. For many projects, this change results in a significantly smaller output size and significantly faster documentation generation. Implemented Issue 31 - Improved repository auto-discovery and formatting. Fixed Issue 33 - Improving usability and documentation of nav customization. Added many additional test cases - Reaching 100% test coverage. Added indicators that let users know what step is occurring during documentation generation. 1.2.4 - September 5 2019 Fixed Issue 23 - A confirmed regression from moving to pdocs that caused root modules to not be auto included. 1.2.3 - September 4 2019 Fixed a bug specifying the output dir for as_html command from the command line. Updated to use Python3.6+ style variable annotations. 1.2.2 - September 4 2019 Fixed a bug specifying modules from command line when no configuration file is present. 1.2.1 - September 3 2019 General improvements to reference code documentation rendering 1.2.0 - September 3 2019 Potentially breaking dependency change release from pdoc3 to pdocs . Migration guide: pyproject.toml config section changes from [tool.portray.pdoc3] to [tool.portray.pdocs] Type annotations are no longer toggleable but are rather always on. 1.1.0 - August 29 2019 Minor Feature release w/ Bug Fixes Added support for specifying modules directly from the CLI and API. Added auto module detect for simple setup.py files. Improved CLI subcommand documentation. Implemented Issue 12 - Clarify what a \"project\" is in documentation. Fixed Issue 2 - UnicodeEncodeError except when running portray. Fixed Issue 10 - Class methods rendered incorrectly. Fixed Issue 17 - Portray silently requires README.md file. 1.0.5 - August 26 PM 2019 Bug fix release Fixed Issue 6 - Failed to open web-browser on startup. Fixed Issue 5 - Some links are missing a trailing slash. Fixed Issue 4 - Class references generate large code block.

NoProjectFound portray raises this exception when it cant find a project in the current directory. This means that there is no pyproject.toml or setup.py file in the directory you ran portray AND that you haven't specified modules to include on the command line. Solution 1: Go to root of project If you do have a pyproject.toml or setup.py file in your project, chances are you simply accidentally ran portray from a different directory. Simply changing back to your projects root directory at the same level as these files should be enough to resolve your issue. Solution 2: Create a pyproject.toml file You can create a simplified pyproject.toml file that explicitly specifies what modules are included in your project: [tool.portray] modules = [\"MY_MODULE\"] Solution 3: Specify the modules manually from the command line Every CLI command supports explicitly setting one or more modules using -m : Unable to identify repo_name, repo_url, and edit_uri automatically. This is a warning that is returned when you haven't manually specified these configuration options and portray is unable to determine them automatically based on your project's repository. There are many reasons that this can happen, the simplest of which are that your project isn't source controlled or you utilize a source control system other than git. Solution 1: Ignore the warning These settings are optional and are used only by certain mkdocs themes to provide links back to your repository. If these features are not relevant to you, you can safely ignore the warning. Solution 2: Manually specify settings in pyproject.toml If for any reason portray is unable to determine the repository information from your repo automatically you can manually specify the settings within your config file: [tool.portray.mkdocs] repo_url = \"MY_REPO_URL\" repo_name = \"MY_REPO_NAME\" edit_uri = \"MY_EDIT_URL\" For more information about these settings, refer to the mkdocs reference documentation .

Optionally, projects that use Hug are encouraged to follow this HOPE and link to it as a reference. PEP 8 Foundation All guidelines in this document are in addition to those defined in Python's PEP 8 and PEP 257 guidelines. Line Length Too short of lines discourage descriptive variable names where they otherwise make sense. Too long of lines reduce overall readability and make it hard to compare 2 files side by side. There is no perfect number: but for Hug, we've decided to cap the lines at 100 characters. Descriptive Variable names Naming things is hard. Hug has a few strict guidelines on the usage of variable names, which hopefully will reduce some of the guesswork: - No one character variable names. - Except for x, y, and z as coordinates. - It's not okay to override built-in functions. - Except for id . Guido himself thought that shouldn't have been moved to the system module. It's too commonly used, and alternatives feel very artificial. - Avoid Acronyms, Abbreviations, or any other short forms - unless they are almost universally understand. Adding new modules New modules added to the a project that follows the HOPE-8 standard should all live directly within the base PROJECT_NAME/ directory without nesting. If the modules are meant only for internal use within the project, they should be prefixed with a leading underscore. For example, def _internal_function. Modules should contain a docstring at the top that gives a general explanation of the purpose and then restates the project's use of the MIT license. There should be a tests/test_$MODULE_NAME.py file created to correspond to every new module that contains test coverage for the module. Ideally, tests should be 1:1 (one test object per code object, one test method per code method) to the extent cleanly possible. Automated Code Cleaners All code submitted to Hug should be formatted using Black and isort. Black should be run with the line length set to 100, and isort with Black compatible settings in place.

Our Standards Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include: Using welcoming and inclusive language Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences Gracefully accepting constructive criticism Focusing on what is best for the community Showing empathy towards other community members Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include: The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks Public or private harassment Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting Our Responsibilities Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior. Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. Scope This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers. Enforcement Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting timothy.crosley@gmail.com . All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. Confidentiality will be maintained with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.
